## Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before diving into the main questions, I performed an initial exploratory data analysis to understand the landscape of the job market. This involved looking at the distribution of job titles, locations, and common benefits. The full analysis can be found in the [0_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb](0_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb) notebook.
